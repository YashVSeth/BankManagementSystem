Bank Management System - Project Statement

Problem Statement

Traditional banking operations usually happen over digital platforms and require heavy and efficient software support in the back-end. The key challenge here is how to design and implement a simple, console-based banking system that will automate basic banking operations: customer account management, financial transactions (deposits and withdrawals), along with value-added services like the calculation of interest, in such a way that data integrity and ease of use are guaranteed.

Project Scope
This project is a standalone Java console application. It is intended for single-user use, such as for bank tellers or for an individual customer managing their account from a terminal. The scope is deliberately focused on core banking principles to ensure a clean implementation of object-oriented programming and multilevel inheritance in Java.
## Target Users

The main users of the system would be:
1. **Bank Tellers:** Personnel able to insert new account information and conduct transactions on behalf of the customers.
2. **Customers**: Those who can access their account details and check balances, deposit, withdraw, or calculate interest, for example, using a self-service kiosk.
Features High Level
* **Account Management:** Create and view detailed customer bank accounts. *   Transaction processing: Deposit and withdraw money securely with validation of balance. *   **Account Inquiry:** Get information about your account balance at any time. *   Interest Calculation: Automatically calculate and display annual interest based on the account type: Savings or Current. * **User-Friendly Menu:** Provided is an interactive and looped console menu for easy navigation.
